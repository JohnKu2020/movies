<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>

<p>This Cookie Policy explains how RE-MOVI, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively “RE-MOVI”, “we”, “us”, and “ours”), use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites, including without limitation RE-MOVI  and any successor URLs, mobile or localized versions and related domains / sub-domains (“Websites”) and/or our mobile application (“App”) and / or our web platform (“Platform”). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

<h4>What are cookies?</h4>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or mobile application. Cookies are then sent back to the originating site on each subsequent visit, or to another site that recognizes that cookies. You can find out more information about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>

<p>Cookies are widely used in order to make sites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the Platform.</p>

<p>We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors (for example, by remembering your language and/or product preferences) and to better understand how our site is used. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our site before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

<h4>What types of cookies do we use?</h4>
<p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>

<p>First party cookies, served directly by RE-MOVI to your computer or mobile device. They are used only by RE-MOVI to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our site.</p>

<p>Third party cookies, which are served by a service provider on our site, and can be used by the service provider to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other sites. Third party cookies are most commonly used for Platform analytics or advertising purposes.</p>

<p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies,’ meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by the site to recognize our computer or mobile device when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</p>

<h4>Why do we use cookies?</h4>
<p>We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and/or App and/or Platform to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites and/or App and/or Platform. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites and/or App and/or Platform for analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
